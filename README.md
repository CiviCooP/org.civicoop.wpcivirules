org.civicoop.wpcivirules
========================

This extension adds CiviRules actions/triggers that interact with the underlying Wordpress installation.  
Requires [CiviRules](https://github.com/civicoop/org.civicoop.civirules), obviously.  

Currently only contains an action to handle user accounts (that *may* even work with other UFs too).  
More WordPress-related functionality may be added in the future.
