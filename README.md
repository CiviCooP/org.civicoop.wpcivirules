org.civicoop.wpcivirules
========================

This extension adds CiviRules actions/triggers that interact with the underlying Wordpress installation.  
Requires [CiviRules](https://github.com/civicoop/org.civicoop.civirules), obviously, as well as [CiviRulesLogger](https://github.com/civicoop/org.civicoop.civiruleslogger).  

For now, this extension only adds an action to add user accounts (currently Wordpress-only, could probably be rewritten to support all UFs). More WordPress-related functionality *may* be added in the future.
