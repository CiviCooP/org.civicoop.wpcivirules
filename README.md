org.civicoop.wpcivirules
========================

This extension adds CiviRules actions/triggers that interact with the underlying Wordpress installation.  
Requires [CiviRules](https://github.com/civicoop/org.civicoop.civirules), obviously, as well as [CiviRulesLogger](https://github.com/civicoop/org.civicoop.civiruleslogger).  

For now, this extension only adds an action to add WP user accounts.   
More WordPress-related triggers/actions *may* be added in the future.  
This functionality is currently Wordpress-only, but could be rewritten to support all UFs. However, similar functionality in Drupal could probably be implemented with Drupal Rules + Entities just as well.
